# Stroke Prediction

This project is created for my Machine Learning Development project and it uses a machine learning model to predict the probability of getting a stroke by past data.

The dataset for this model is gotten from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).

This project is built using pandas, numpy, sklearn, flask and tailwindcss.

## Installation and Usage
To run this project run these commands first:
```
npm install
npm run build:css
```
This is to ensure the tailwindcss is properly installed and instantiated.

Afterwards you can just execute all the cells in the file `app.ipynb` to run the flask app.
